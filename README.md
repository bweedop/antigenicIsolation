The `src/` directory contains files needed to get your R environment ready for the project. 
  - All dependencies are listed in the `dependencies.R` file. 
  - Environment variables that are needed for analyses are located in `environment.R`

`scripts/` contains scripts divided by languages R and python. 
  - R scripts are really only used for extracting data from sequences and some plotting.
  - python scripts are where you can find the Jupyter notebooks that implement the isolation forest algorithm.
  
`notebook/` is where you can find a description of the data and some explanation of the project.
